57,1533386662503399425,Not so little that we've been through
58,1533371083738517504,The reason is

68,1533314829397676032,"40% of those tested, and in fact 60% of the population may suffer from chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity."
69,1533309827052617728,The first reason is unsuccessful and useless decisions
70,1533294733560524801,And 90% are overwhelmed

100,1533126803778330627,"The main reason is lifestyle and most eats fast food. You find fruit juice, mixed with white sugar, and added to it ice cream, sweetened with Nutella, some sugar particles in biscuits, and a concentrated Vimtoa. Maybe it contan 1000 heat capacity.

121,1531446374247583744,Natural because the level of per capita income is the lowest in the Gulf countries..
122,1531394727102365696,"For example in Emirates if you order chicken they will give you half a chicken of rice which is enough for two people but in Oman especially Muscat a quarter of a chicken of rice is enough for one person, at the same prices."

148,1531260598729773056,"I do not thing our restaurant better than Gulf countries restaurant so no need to be more expensive, moreover most of Omanis depend on home made meals"

150,1531256278613368832,Always criticism... if they say something good about Oman
151,1531253103466536964,Cheapest restaurants because salary is 325 beople starving
152,1531247567627075585,"More comes from Oman News..instead of standing with citizens with the lowest salaries in the Gulf, and this is what you were able to publish"
153,1531241319707906049,In this true
154,1531237405403099141,"Yes, because it is not healthy and it is prepared incorrectly, That is why it is so cheap"

156,1531235412752080897,"There is a restaurant called house of ....  it is overpriced, the food is very ordinary and the service is poor.."
157,1531234523719032834,Most of restaurants are Bengali or Pakistani

166,1531219555422556160,"This is due to several reasons, including the quality of restaurants and the meals they provide, as well as the low level of per capita income and living standards."
167,1531216403612717056,"It is all a lie, nothing is cheaper than it. This is a promotion to raise prices"

264,1531166279792467968,I think the one who compared it between the Bengali restaurants in Oman and the fancy restaurants in the Gulf and said that they are cheaper
265,1531166208644489216,We have restaurants where the price of sandwiches is 200 baisa and there are restaurants that cost 10 riyals
266,1531166004499324928,It's not true just pretending and deceptive propaganda
267,1531165944239620096,Leave the news a secret tomorrow they will increase the prices because it is cheap
268,1531165482027458560,😂 😂 😂
269,1531164976119009281,The quality varies and if there was a proportion between the salaries and the prices of restaurants they would find that the meals are expensive compared to other countries

271,1531164389411274752, Sultanate of Oman has the lowest salaries in the Gulf countries
272,1531164014373490690,"I took dinner, lunch and breakfast in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for less than the prices of the Sultanate of Oman .. What is the criterion that was evaluated .. Or is it intended in the evaluation of tourist restaurants"
273,1531163958769602560,Barata Dal

276,1531163673997332482,In Heikal Restaurant has biryani riyal it is impossible to find this price in the Gulf
277,1531163578400706560,Complete and said the lowest salaries in Gulf countries
278,1531163528089985025,If the sandwich has a little bit of chips and sauce it becomes a riyal and a half
279,1531163160471904256,Less quantity and smaller in size🌚
280,1531163156332027905,McDonald's increases their meal prices everyday
281,1531163086966730752,Honestly lias Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are a thousand times cheaper and tastier
282,1531163030079393792,And the lowest salaries and welfare for the citizen as well..
283,1531162910797479937,You took the opinion of non-Omanis.. But the opinion of the Omani is the opposite of this
284,1531162910575190017,The lowest salaries in the Gulf countries
285,1531162497151008769,"One of the restaurants in Maabila, the price of a burger is two riyals or more without chips without a drink and the size of the sandwich is like finger"
286,1531162455031808000,Cheaper but not the same quality as their restaurants
287,1531162402212945920,"The Sultanate of Oman has the lowest salaries in the Gulf countries. Therefore, no matter how cheap the meals are in your view, they remain expensive compared to the level of income."
288,1531161961253294082,The Sultanate of Oman is the lowest Gulf country in salaries.
289,1531161904118382593,You are trying to show it better people know and understand everything there is no need to pretend we know it and we know what is in it and we know the Gulf countries and what is in them

291,1531161682914975745,Restaurant could not raise prices
292,1530857431185637378,🔴 The number of females is less than males in the Sultanate of Oman.
293,1531828842029006848,it is all a lie

301,1531269412996644866,80% of those in the streets are driving girls according to the testimony of people from abroad
302,1531268093946777600,But the difference is 1% we consider you equal no one gets upset

313,1531141768409931778,We need to import from abroad to cover the deficit and prevent monopoly
314,1531141306172456960,The polygamy argument is over to reduce spinsterhood
315,1531117865180479488,import females..the world is full..

329,1530965169123246080,Why is spinsterhood increasing There are those who are over the age of thirty and have not married. Where are the men
330,1530961746994814977,Ha-ha-ha-do you remember the famous lie? The number of females is greater so they marry four to reduce spinsterhood? 🤣
331,1530958820679241729,So the female team is incomplete 😱😱😱
332,1530942921653903360,Therefore the prices are high due to the shortage. 😂
333,1530942702652628999,Good to change the offspring 
334,1530936142278889475,Therefore marriage from abroad should be allowed

341,1530915069353201666,This news is incorrect
342,1530913782964297728,Since I was born I have seen the statistics that males are more than females..
343,1530913290993508352,Let us get marriage from abroad 😍
344,1530907836133392384,I dont think so
345,1530907439394131968,Truly nonexistent 😉
346,1530898578796945408,Therefore it will become easier to obtain permits for marriage from abroad

351,1530895077454884865,Nobody knows you
352,1530894807446560769,I expect this study and census are incorrect because most families have more females than males and this is found in most areas and villages.
353,1530893426807517184,Ok bring us immigrants we want them 😍
354,1530890833163075586,"So that they do not become extinct, preserve them"
355,1530890733086973952,Good bring from abroad
356,1530890259579412480,This information needs to be reviewed in terms of the percentage of males or
357,1530884580076576771,Even if the percentage of females is lower due to unemployment males will not marry and spinsterhood will remain.
358,1530880931795435521,But the spinsterhood rate is high
359,1530880570649083904,Every house has 4 or 5 children but one of them is a boy and the rest are all girls I think you still don't know the country's statistics from the day we were in school they said the population was 2 million and when our children got married they say the same thing when you get educated.
360,1530880428533600257,Do you count travelers?
361,1530877506575810561,That's why they are spinsters at home
362,1530876945063460870,If you count the total number it is natural that most of the workers are men but the reality is that Omanis are more women
363,1530876386709315584,Hit them better so that they have females
364,1530875659471429632,That's why I didn't find a wife
365,1530873236673765376,Nice stats but not accurate
366,1530873049121161216,Understand the news they did not said Omanis male more than female they said in Oman
367,1530871807364026368,really??
368,1530871106852225027,First time we beat them 😂
369,1530869989560950784,When their number was greater they said polygamy.
370,1530868722864476162,This is unfair.. Where are the rights of women (memorize without understanding 🌚)
371,1530867322025558017,They have no excuse to say polygamy number of females is few

378,1530865587857108994,However the number of female job seekers is higher than males
379,1530864934455746560,In the whole world the proportion of females is less than the proportion of males
380,1530864464047886336,Tomboy was counted with our team ?
381,1530864004679311361,And the study before it encourages polygamy 😂😂
382,1530863542827622401,Is it only Omanis or expatriates with them . Exactly if with expatriates the proportion of males is more
383,1530862536215740416,I know males this statistic caused them a psychological crisis
384,1530861914536001536,let us married from abroad

525,1529342508500647937,"In Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and others, people wear masks even before Corona, because if someone is sick with influenza, he does not want to infect others, and this is the culture of high-end peoples. We, the Arabs, took the matter personally and were indifferent to the health of others, and this is called selfishness. One would say I didn't wear it, as if he was proud that he contributed to the infection of others"
526,1529337980128747520,For me I can't without a mask and I'm used to being masked I'll wear it
527,1528853948374843393,"The mask was for a specific thing and it's over, it's like the end of the academic year. If a person passed it, does he like to repeat the year even though he's succeeded?

540,1528641968171098117,No of course Thank God for this blessing we were relieved of it
541,1528639995468185600,I will wear it everywhere
542,1528639586251034626,I used to wear it now I went to Umrah in Ramadan I saw the world there no one wore it fully except for very few I came back to Oman and didn't wear it
543,1528636841498484737,Yesterday I went to Oman mall. 99% of people weren't wearing a mask
544,1528634282947796993,The questions have finished?
545,1528633322187931649,God Almighty have saved and freed us from this restriction
546,1528631656868888578,We

549,1528620509071654913,I'm wearing it today
550,1528617429039038465,If it was necessary like dust and polluted places It's better and more guaranteed
551,1528615695495340032,I would wear it in case the place is crowded

555,1528606716115435521,Nothing is focing us to wear it... and I don't think it played an active role in the first place in preventing the spread of the disease
556,1528606169635463168,Yes I will keep wearing it to protect myself
557,1528603772594933760,Yes it's okay
558,1528602634080464896,Whether they lifted them or not we don't wear it
559,1528602384078974976,Yes I will wear it whenever there is a need
560,1528599510225756160,I haven't worn it for a long time 😁😁😁😁
561,1528599302305632257,I only wear it if I was sick only to not cause the infection of anyone
562,1528594533067501568,"For me, I won't give it up in crowded places and markets"
563,1528594019013492737,No
564,1528585711959564289,It became a trend with some people

570,1528572322415886336,Wearing masks is an Asian habit since before the appearance of Corona virus because of the outbreaks of pandemics and it used to attract attention and now at our time it became a habit with us even after lifting the restrictions. And it will be a trend especially with women 😌 
571,1528570593909645312,I can't give it up especially in crowded places
572,1528567230694309888,Since the statement is to not obligatory to wear a mask then we don't need it permanently but we can make use of the remaining pack in:

725,1528344128865583105,They lifted the restrictions so that they now work on the new disease and create restrictions other than the Corona virus's They already saw that people now started to understand the situation
726,1528343283369447425,No We now don't wear masks

730,1528341723021189120,Of course at some places and occasions there is no way but to wear it this is for my own good Not only because it was fear of a ticket or an entry refusal
731,1528341140713390082,"Of course not and a thousand no, I mean have masks protected us, we are fooling ourselves... A virus that we can not see with our eyes... A mask would drive it away..."
732,1528341067594190849,6 pieces are left with me
733,1528340759065284608,"Of course, it is useful at times of gatherings and whenever you're in an environment with polluted air"
734,1528340684457005059,No..Before the Corona virus we didn't use to wear it on streets or malls but only during work.. We'll go back to how we were if God wills

737,1528339975321812997,"Yes and for me I must, especially in gathering places. But frankly you'd feel that you're strange to people because most of them don't wear a mask and are surprised by you 😷"
738,1528339702201434113,Then why did they lift the restrictions if we'd wear masks?
739,1528339640322822144,Yes especially in hospitals
740,1528339431643656202,So now do the people who want to travel need a vaccination certificate or is it already cancelled?

742,1528338912829132801,I swear I haven't worn the mask for a while 
743,1528338699662106625,The people who say yes either don't have a brain or they're out of service. Oh human why did I then get vaccinated 😂 It's true that whoever want to fool people should come to Arabs as they get fooled easily 😂😂
744,1528338133745541122,So this heat isn't enough so we even wear masks 🙂🙂

919,1528009539555049474,Intelligence depends on reading books and Holy Quran and watching educational films and revealing everything around it That's how the kid will become smart and intelligent

934,1527928614221762560,one but it's stronger 😎👌🏼
935,1527928337850580992,Intelligence isn't inherited But books and science are the ones that creates it As an uneducated smart person has no use in life He's just like a fool

941,1527920095107895298,True and I witness

946,1527913589176156160,Yes I swear and I witness
947,1527913448348307456,The most important thing is that they don't inherit their stupidity from them 🙂🙂
948,1527913378496319489,a crap study 
949,1527913377074491393,Each person has his own intelligence the father and mother are only mere factors

952,1527912333678366720,There's no such thing as inheriting intelligence.

1063,1527221452520534018,Maybe he wanted to travel with her
1064,1527221006338859011,And then a donkey comes running from afar saying a man has no feelings 🥵🏃
1065,1527220802470531078,it's either out of joy or that he borrowed money so that she has fun and he pays the installments
1066,1527220742194089986,You drained the comment about the Spanish man and the Spanish man
1067,1527220686984454145,I swear the stroke he had is because she's emptied his pocket not leaving a single Baisa That's why he had a stroke no love and no nothing
1068,1527220610459439106,Maybe he got sick of her all the way

1074,1527527836415844353,Your words are true
1075,1527507147252285440,You could have said low wages You don't need to specify 350 Now even the one who used to give more will be encouraged to reduce salaries 👎🏻👎🏻
1076,1527499969187430415,They're contradictory When the statement came out by the ministery undersecretary they said the minister didn't discuss it with us and got upset and now after a while he comes to say we're better than other countries God is the helper.
1077,1527496942560886787,Neither tourism nor economy will be with us on these salaries
1078,1527448314744037393,Where is the official let him try this salary for a few years and he'll know how!
1079,1527434405266046987,nepotism is the most important thing at this time🥱
1080,1527187274747678720,Wake up 
1081,1527184256652410880,God's curse upon every official whose concern is to make citizens sick with negative news.
1082,1527183241429540866,Both sectors aren't attractive anymore
1083,1527183040597872641,And they dare to ask why people suffer from stress
1084,1527182522337075200,For how many years have we been hearing about several meeting and consultations that are all in vain
1085,1527182385699246080,We don't want a pay rise or anything else Don't tire yourselves by the meetings and studies
1086,1527181901244555264,Such a decision will limit the desire of young people to study at university.
1087,1527181427858624513,What is this Teachers are resigning and students are dropping out of school to help their families
1088,1527181061255569409,This is not good
1089,1527180833160830977,Now I got why our colleagues have pressure It's because of those news you come with 😂
1090,1527180317022371840,And what about those who got employed before this statement how much is their salaries?? More than 900 rials and the one who didn't get a job and is a graduate just like his colleagues gets 325 or 500... Tell me about justice
1091,1527179753685385217,Congrats
1092,1527177860284309505,I swear they have failed so bad Pray to God to rid us of them and their mentalities

1094,1527177151463800832,Oh how nice 🙂🙂
1095,1527177117733101568,"In Oman there's nothing that has been agreed upon like the officials' statements as if they were siblings, They are in total agreement on anything that is against the citizen"
1096,1527176497030627328,This is contradictory We didn't know you
1097,1527176290670985216,Meaning that the degree has become worthless in hiring! Honor the holders of certificates and knowledge!
1098,1527176146365960193,Is this the approach of justice
1099,1527176128233889798,May God have mercy on you Qaboos bin Saeed and have mercy on your days
1100,1527176035959296009,The minimum wage is supposed to be 600 rials becuse of the situation we're living and the high prices and taxes and bills
1101,1527175655233814528,325 don't make a decent life for an individual
1102,1527175621260062720,Lol
1103,1527247684242968576,We're doomed
1104,1527189581761765376,hhhhhhh
1105,1527000724546125824,Again
1106,1527211998416707584,no comment
1107,1527157948279136258,God forgive me
1108,1527198118621618176,Impossible
1109,1526874237893476352,Impossible
1110,1527374523082780682,"watch the interview, and he mentioned lots of reasons"
1111,1527374352273944606,"It was mentioned today by Nabhan Al Battashi in the radio, they don't have any probable reason.. except that the company owners are foreigners."
1112,1527273040739975168,Is it possible that the government doesn't know about companies lay-off?! ()
1113,1527160243704283136,"The problem is that the Ministry of Labour and the law itself gave the foreigners the right of ruling the country, and we don't really know if Oman is led by Omanis or is it just an outer frame and in reality it is ruled by a foreigner."
1114,1527139987485073411,His fault is that he is an Omani citizin living in the third decade of the twenty first century.
1115,1527139396935368704,"His fault is that he doesn't shake his head while talking, and his fault is that he doesn't know how to say that he know every thing, and his fault that he is not better than anyone else."
1116,1527117776653099009,The worst decision that the Ministry of Labour took was the 325 Rial salary that caused people getting laid-off their occupations.. other than that there isn't any deterrent penalties for companies.. Laws aren't helping citizins as much as they are adding on companies balance.
1117,1527038445205463048,His fault is the he is Omani?!
1118,1527025822455963650,"Don't count on her, if she was the minister she would make the salary 99 Rial."
1119,1527005851294236672,This might be just for show.
1120,1527004738906120192,Why don't they let youth work outside the country?
1121,1526982020387176450,His fault is that there is no clear legal article that protects him from company owners whom are the accoutable originally.
1122,1526979527691456518,In short... people in charge vindicate that locals lack experience
1123,1526944977674182656,The absence of the legislative rule of the Consultative Assembly is one of those reasons
1124,1526938562167447554,There is no sin but that he is 
1125,1526934913278156803,train your kids on grazing sheep
1126,1526934563020316675,Even the wolf 🤔🙄
1127,1526924534334488577,Since five years my salary hasn't increased and when I wanted to complain I was intimidated of moving me to another branch away from where I live. What do you think the solution is should I stay silent or as a citizen no one would protect you but god
1128,1526920464966332417,Don't make it worse (for god's sake?) I swear we are 
1129,1526914316208939013,I couldn't understand is ther job is being questioned in public like us or are they supposed to work on solutions
1130,1526904384692551680,his fault is that he is Omani 😫
1131,1526901904877436929,his fault is that we have an official who manipulated him with few decisions
1132,1526891021140885505,This question should be forwarded to our rational government.
1133,1526889121939070976,He hasn't committed any sin.. but his miserable luck made him live in a community where most ministers of his government are ''merchants'' enacting laws considering their own economical benefits first. 
1134,1526884128993443843,"Discuss this topic with the Ministry of Labour, the citizen himself doesn't know what is going on."
1135,1526883837950705666,Ask the government
1136,1526883141281095680,The weird thing is that the laid off is citizen citizen citizen and in his own country while the employee is foreigner foreigner foreigner enjoying the welfare of the country this has never happened except with us
1137,1526881236236619779,His fault is that he is Omani and all the doors are shut 
1138,1526923532487254023,"We have OCD, suicidal thoughts and desperation since a long time."
1139,1526895399121956864,"True I got OCD after I caught Corona, no sleeping nor rest to sit or move, can't taste and no food desire, headache, feeling hot for few minutes and then cold at the same time, it;s more like magic not a desease"
1140,1526855744703844359,"Most mental issues are because of not applying actual islamic codes in social, politicial  and economical life as well as fighting honest islam "
1141,1526851226666684416,I swear it's not because of corona its because of the un-safe vaccination people became terrefied from the imposed vaccination
1142,1526830621078835201,This is bullshit
1143,1526810999390601217,"No one will reach you except the poor citizen. The one who's living in a palace, mind peace and has thousands in his credit won't get OCD, try to suicide nor even realise that there is people living at this situation."
1144,1526810704870776833,Lack of faith
1145,1526802210612465664,"Those verses are specified to peace of mind, and it's conditions are clear."
1146,1526797565169131522,What are the reasons
1147,1526738666000990208,God forgive me
1148,1526649530355224578,This is because of problems and debts not Corona
1149,1526643267361701889,"OCD, WHAT IS THIS?"
1150,1526635637507559426,Yes when you cutoff elderly salaries
1151,1526635313178857472,Its a must.. vaccination is not safe.. and people are forced to get it.. what should they feel other than anxious!
1152,1526629729830412289,Not just in Corona phase even now cases will increase in the upcoming days if you didn't catch up with it... because of this harsh life and poverty and misery that most citizens are living
1153,1526627732003729408,What happened wasn't easy
1154,1526617235095273475,"Because of lockdown, debts, inflation and taxes"
1155,1526616666309894150,The best part of Corona is marrige easy and fast
1156,1526614717086814209,"A main reason is being away from god, the second reason is more thinkking of financial issues and fear of future."
1157,1526612521658064896,"It's all bullshit, the reason is the misery we are living"
1158,1526610046842548226,Why should we write a comment when no one replys
1159,1526603853919027201,What about High Blood Pressure did you study it
1160,1526603401580187650,Why and what are the reasons
1161,1526602434977615872,"The best part of Corona is that there is less annoying visits, one has lived best days with no visits because of wonderfull quarentine"
1162,1526602327485972482,Lay-off..Debts..Costs..Inflation.. and many reasons
1163,1526482515267141632,A third of Oman's population have high blood pressure.
1164,1529191204436557824,because of the miserable lifestyle in this country
1165,1527974812123029504,"I assume because of the happiness, thanks god."
1166,1527545855170977792,For sure we will get pressured
1167,1526887916160565249,O god help us
1168,1526850698586927104,Isn't it time for hypertension reading to change too accordingly?! 70/120 is a reading within the range and until mid 40s. What's after that?! Why do we expect same readings while the body is changing from the inside before the outside?!
1169,1526841065059549185,Didn't they look for reasons?
1170,1526837990571462657,How could we not get hypertension while what we faced wasn't easy.. I ask the mighty lord for his mercy
1171,1526826539911888896,"Only a third, mistaken"
1172,1526825760723456001,"Experts say that the maximum salt consumption amount shuldn't be more than 5 grams a day, which is one tea spoon and a half of sodium."
1173,1526824278414577664,"because of wealthm welfare, great salaries and lifestyle high blood pressurem heart diseases and diabetes is a must"
1174,1526788656937279488,not because of anything but grudges towards responsible people
1175,1526780788313931776,"because of the heavy burdens of low income, lay-off and unemployment"
1176,1526775019912761351,They aren't blamed hahaha

1335,1520751950337347584,in Ramadan and you're still lying to us
1336,1520750225585020928,Get rid of these forms from the airline
1337,1520749136529739776,I hope one responsible employee comes out and say something good
1338,1520748857260494848,Who's hear we met with airlines  
1339,1520748503961645056,I think the amount that is discounted
1340,1520748209206927360,"before two weeks I want to return from Salalah and I checked at afternoon for 90 O.R, isn't it haram and domestic flight it is AlSalam airlines  "
1341,1520744873908920326,the reasonable price is 20 O.R for round trip ticket
1342,1520743389293129731,The proverb says slow and steady wins the race
1343,1520742923545022464,that reminds me of masks prices at the beginning of covid at the end of 2019
1344,1520742874299707392,"from Muscat to Salalah and vice versa only a ticket for 60 and sometimes 77 , if I traveled to Iran it will be cheaper"
1345,1520741396092796928,all are two companies 
1346,1520738630393815041,"you exerted effort , there was no need "
1347,1520738393977675776,"Play a joke on people.. past year in fall season the prices skyrocketed and the air line reply was (tickets depends on demand, offer) and so in other sectors like communication and other"
1348,1520737566173114369,some competing companies have expertise in marketing advertises and strong competition not like us the most important with us is the fast income and rise in ticket prices when a new CEO comes have no economic feasibility profit and good marketing they only have rising prices compensating the company from the failure before it that is only what you know rising the prices 
1349,1520737450699767809,it's all unreal nothing is true 
1350,1520735393330745344,we have failure and no ability for competeting the most importent thing is the rising in prices how many losse the rising bring to the avitaion sector 80 million why ofcoursly from the tickets price rising everyone is looking for the cheap even if it is 20 riyals lesser but the problem is if you have mindes that doesn't think and do not take advantage of opportunities by reducing tickets prices and gaining a large number of customers
1351,1520730579225956352,dude make your brain bigger
1352,1520730383821778944,celebrate 😁

1354,1520729866781536257,they share the bonus then they say we lose 
1355,1520729644793802753,it is those news accounts that talk about you otherwise you are a pack of lies
1356,1520729357207154694,if 30 riyals Muscat Salalah Salalah Muscat good otherwise is not acceptable
1357,1520728738790576128,I hope from people when they travel reserve from Abu Dhabi cheaper tickets rather than depending on Oman Air or Alsalam air 
1358,1520728032545284096,I hope you lose until the day of judgment 
1359,1520727404704157696,discounting some services which are travel with less weight and without meals and like that
1360,1520726186090975233,what are these services 
1361,1520726059196592128,With this we can see photos or videos of Omanis traveling from their country to Abu Dhabi and from there they return to their country then they travel to Abu Dhabi and then return to their country because of cheap prices and this will encourage airlines to reduce prices for other airlines and this is in the interest of the consumer and these countries will benefit through increased tourism and the movement of markets hotels and others
1362,1520725512687083520,"we met and talk blah blah blah all is nonsense ,if there were no specified tickets price in a clarified table and the maximum ticket price ,this talk have no benefit"
1363,1520724428807680001,when the fall comes make the ticket for 130 or 150 ok?

1365,1520723248786415618,shame on you demosteritic airlines are expensive and the citizen shouts 
1366,1520722394335350784,also bottle of water or a juice or a pie is for riyal or two and the ticket is for 90 .80 riyals 
1367,1520721931351191552,let it flow 
1368,1520721796554711040,"God knows better  the ticket price is the same ,discounting means the services like weight and so on "
1369,1520721795225161730,Allah it is Whose help is to be sought and Allah doth guide everyone cause of failing is clear and winners and getters are the external companies because they take advantages of the high prices in the Sultanate and compete with international markets 😂🇴🇲
1370,1520721453653663750,"Where are you CEO, the people of the country for years from Salalah to Muscat and vice versa the ticket is for above 45 riyals ??!!!"
1371,1520720870578298882,supposed to declare the price as you have large position so everyone knows it
1372,1520720821706240001,never mind them lie their plans are exposed
1373,1520720660078727169,when the market opened for competition the real prices shows up which encourage buying
1374,1520720370097176582,Domestic airlines. who hear say a fleet of airlines

1377,1520719252948406273,if we want to go to Salalah we'll go by car despite that road is full of radars ....😁😁
1378,1520719120446234624,if the Emirati Wizz airlines prices between Abu Dhabi and Salalah less than 10 riyals so why the Oman airline ticket price with less distance is about 80 riyals??!!.
1379,1520719090649817090,"Hahahahaha, the request is to reduce flight prices"
1380,1520718985528061952,seems nothing true... wash your hand not more than that

1784,1519318431614570498,first fixs the streets then talk about the tourist attraction..the streets are broken and do not live up the the level of the project unfortunately
1785,1519314418319998978,They say what they don't do..and at the end one comes out to us and justifies the reasons for the delay the first of which is a budget deficit.. they always blame the budget .. poor planning is a major reason for delaying our projects..
1786,1519311077191917569,when is this dream

1789,1519220783523979266,we hear about it but all they do is studing the project
1790,1519216501299068928,this is s reserve for the

1796,1519190282880880641,You have a lot of interest in the public view and politics and other things that fill the pockets of officials but a total concern for the citizen is impossible
1797,1519176074835415045,Now this is a project
1798,1519171904338374657,Ok great but I expect they will make a construction agreement in 2050 or 2100?
1799,1519154501529346049,hahaha
1800,1519126607763591174,If they do sprinklers above it as if it were artificial rain the place would look magical like a forest

I visited the project two years ago and hope that it will be part of a general plan that includes other advanced stages, the most important of which is the presence of laboratories and a vision for a botanical museum and the most important types of advanced agriculture, a place for an exhibition of agricultural products, and even an institute, college or research center.. Thank you for those in charge on the project"
1804,1519073509099593729,Too much 😂😂😂😂 at the end it will become like a Al Khoud garden with a few sparse dry trees.
1805,1519070124388589568,Where is it?
1806,1519068905825787905,first repair Al Khoud Street and then work on a garden

1816,1519049489645977600,Why don't they interest us and show some of the garden's features
1817,1519049000200155139,Go away we are disgusted by your lies..you act like you're smart and lie to innocent people..at least twenty years they are talking about and they booked the place.. at the end when the opening is done we will laugh at its absurdity
1818,1519047343689113602,When is the opening?
1819,1519046545609474051,How many thousands did it cost  mountains and desert attract tourists

1842,1519187122581819392,Honestly happy news. I hope to bring in talent and the elite among them to have a footprint in development and investment. The large number of arrivals would improve purchasing power and the already collapsed real estate sector. I wish the restrictions would be lifted gradually. The country is large and vast but the population density is very limited in certain cities
1843,1519182811399340039,The Ministry of Labor is crowded because of auditors and permissions because the market is starting to return to normal after the Corona crisis

1849,1519098547718791168,A million of them have fled from their sponsor and are assured that they are in a safe place without being searched or raided

1860,1519029405296832514,"The increase in the number of expatriates will create government jobs for Omanis. Including increasing security, municipalities, manpower, health, transaction clearance offices, increasing movement in public and private transportation and increasing competitiveness in small professions and all of this is good for the Sultanate and the citizen."
1861,1519024771744374784,I expect that by 2040 you will not find a citizen only expatriates hahahaha
1862,1519022591478013952,"Bring them and teach them business and then say there are no jobs.. These are all past Inmates and drug addicts.

1871,1518986335406673922,If the government does not act by reducing the number of arrivals there are negative security implications that may fall on Omani society

1919,1518822295791411200,A good suggestion frankly will drop the dowries and the costs of marriage because there is another option that is less expensive and in many cases more efficient with the help of God.
1920,1518819877934579714,Why are there any laws and conditions for any Muslim why do you forbid what God has permitted?!!! In fact this is an unjust law the human rights must do something who are they to forbid what God has permitted.
1921,1518804965178937346,"Before you demand the number, pay attention to the selly issues and causes of trivial divorce those who have more than one wife and their disregard for justice in married life..with regard to marriage from abroad, if the state saw that there is good in it, it would not have prevented it and the farce that happened in one of the years when they were getting married and divorced.. I think it 's better to focus on your parliamentary duties to attract the opinions of the public."
1922,1518798926039687169,Enough blind imitation when someone's daughter get engaged they increase the dowry but when their son asks for marriage they decrease them as if they were selling and paying. this is the time to imitate other societies since we introduced the white dress and the wedding stages and the weddings in the halls and the buffets. every girl wants to do better than the others so nobody will say it wasn't a beautiful wedding
1923,1518788408612638720,If someone whose religion and character you are pleased with comes to you then marry him

1928,1518717674930733056,"This is a sound decision if it is made because the people are asking for a imaginary amounts dowry is reasonable when marreing from outsibe abroad,,  specify marriages from certain countries such as marrying a Yemeni and a Gulf citizen and from the Levant and Morocco"
1929,1518710705255501824,I don't know how they think *******
1930,1518672610015522817,"Raising societal awareness to reduce dowries and facilitate the costs of marriage is better than marriage from outside the country, which rarely succeeds due to different cultures and customs.!"
1931,1518669587960713229,Origin and lineage and comfort and arabis and customs and traditions are gone.

1938,1518571158232252416,"But this does not prevent you from finding another person who praises this marriage, and that is why they said (If it wasn't for the different tastes.....)"
1939,1518552958052536320,Marriage from abroad has more problems than advantages.
1940,1518550948305584128,This is dangerous in the long run. It is not recommended except in force majeure circumstances. We appeal to the people of the country to facilitate marriage matters. There is also no objection to having a government fund responsible for marriage through loans and so on so that everyone can marry without any debts and obstacles.
1941,1518543545614970882,Excellent this is an indirect way to confront dowry dealers and  those who prevent halal and racists and support single women and spinsters.

1950,1518534030613954560,Facilitating dowries and reducing demands and expenses is better than marrying from abroad
1951,1518533970304110592,what's new. Terms and conditions are there

2011,1519556195371073536,they employ them for a year then they lay them off so nothing changes
2012,1519239154168647682,On gad nothing have changed
2013,1518558384131383297,The graduates are increasing every year
2014,1518498099739643904,What replacement and what recruitment It's all an illusion
2015,1518498036183441408,Employees through mediation
2016,1518494618723274752,Where did you hire them we've been waiting for 5 tears
2017,1518480302414471168,We are staing here and you continue shading
2018,1518440953211674628,Replacing 🤔
2019,1518375362262179841,Why are the names of young people not published in the oifficial paper so that there is credibility in the matter of employment. ...because frankly we have not heard or seen that anyone has been employed.
2020,1518356933446713344,Who said that replacement is feasible for the labor market creating a competitive and strong economy that accommodates the citizen and the expatriate is imperative in order to develop the economy.. As for expelling the expatriate the citizen will have a future setback.
2021,1518316127209902088,My brother is still in the house for 4 years
2022,1518287172205490176,When was this?? then why are people complaining ?? 
2023,1518286828322926601,Did you believe..
2024,1518211978220740608,Yes all of it by mediation
2025,1518208492401688576,I have four brothers and none of them got hired

2029,1518201141049311232,I have a son that has been nearly 6 years since he graduated from university and is still unemployed we want him to work ..........
2030,1518185746187833344,We don't want anything
2031,1518177623637118980,Unfortunately companies are laying off people and on the other hand the ministry employs but the job of a driver and a worker And perhaps some delegates to carry out company transactions in government institutions
2032,1518177106932416512,It's Ramadan
2033,1518176297679310851,We wish that the one who authorized of this number will declare the evidence in front of the people and publicly  in front of the television cameras in order to reassure the people and the credibility of this news.
2034,1518173908805033986,Thank God
2035,1518171643281088513,My brother was hired to a temporary contract last year
2036,1518170171231412224,Incorrect statistics it's just a renewing and temporary contracts and fake contracts
2037,1518163915544440834,This is what newspapers say we've heard a lot and have had enough
2038,1518163780093595648,People it's a sin to lie in this holy month of Ramadan 
2039,1518162534192320514,But I didn't get hired and none of the people I know got hired who exactly did you hire?
2040,1518161903708737536,Is this true or is it just a joke
2041,1518156925137047552,hhhhhhh
2042,1518153561259098112,A completely unclear statement.
2043,1518153515356590081,In Ramadan in Ramadan
2044,1518151180739919873,Excellent.
2045,1518149955495645185,We all know that this is not true except them
2046,1518149228035551237,My brothers got employed
2047,1518148728577740805,Statements from Jolly Chic and Shein 😁🏃 ♀️
2048,1518146830378442752,Where do you get these citizens from we haven't heard of anyone that got hired in the past tree months
2049,1518146794122792961,What replacing and what Employing !!! temporary contracts and then return as job seekers.. cheap statistics
2050,1518145702450368512,Maybe
2051,1518145512955949057,Even the 
2052,1518145069525741568,Is this a statistic why not mention the ratio between replacement and employment why combine and determine the quantity in this way
2053,1518144967155269632,"10 thousand arguments you have to justify
"
2054,1518144461926195200,On God it's all just Lying on the people
2055,1518144407299629056,At least respect this holy month and save your lies for after Ramadan
2056,1518144360457646081,😳😳😳😳😳😳😳It's still Ramanad
2057,1518143002895659008,oh ok good
2058,1518142699521642501,10000 thousand watermelons
2059,1518141843334176768,I've been without a job for seven years 💔
2060,1518141226956042240,In Ramadan? In Ramadaaaaan
2061,1518141089437335552,Nice number
2062,1518140516696797186,May I know which of the government departments and ministries you've replaced jobs? and ten thousand!
2063,1518140275058782211,Lying even in the month of Ramadan? wow
2064,1518140121790488577,Where are they we didn't see anyone going to work
2065,1518140014416343042,Does not make since  😂😂
2066,1518907725173993473,Of course the profits will rise this is a normal thing we are no longer talking about the topic..
2067,1518701563904208904,My family and I have come to the firm conclusion that this company only cares about the purely material return and is not here to serve the public or make life easier for them.
2068,1518701067856498688,Unfortunately after difficult years of my requests to this company to connect the home internet service we discovered that it had refrained from providing the service to a citizen thus causing material losses that exceeded his capabilities as an employee and negatively affected the educational and cognitive achievement of his children over the past years since mid 2017.
2069,1518586182606729216,Your services are too bad 😂
2070,1518574988705607683,It is very normal to rise due to the completion of the infrastructure projects in which it was investing
2071,1518534066500476929,"May all these profits In hell in God willing all of it is forbidden money, theft and looting"
2072,1518504837616488449,If the people knew the counterculture we would be ok
2073,1518390848702099463,On God you stole it from our pockets
2074,1518384347157610496,By what right do you take riyals for messages without my consent and subscription??!
2075,1518383609857597446,There is a tweet by Sheikh Saeed Al-Shasha’i explaining the source of its profits with logic and reason
2076,1518357969838161924,Of course because I pay 35 riyals every month
2077,1518322656281571329,Where did Omantel get these profits from?
2078,1518320308851253248,It is strange that they provided a good service
2079,1518307375329026055,It's all from the people's pockets they do not even make discounts on subscriptions or offer offers to subscribers
2080,1518295661036331010,They deserve it for the services they provide us 🙂
2081,1518292537710202880,May God not forgive them for every baisa they took unjustly
2082,1518275910906036224,It is forbidden and they will bear this sin until doomsday
2083,1518275631691276288,I hope you don't gain in every baisa you win
2084,1518275095025836034,"We are so disgusted we don't even want to contact anymore, free us from these phones"
2085,1518274974158663686,The network in the first week is good and after a week even snapchat is not working
2086,1518274606062358529,We subscribe with 10 and the bill will reach 70 riyals. Who benefits more me or you?!
2087,1518266949922443264,How much zakat is paid by this company? The zakat must be fixed on it and distributed to the poor and the wea and the people imprisoned because of debts
2088,1518255056096796675,May God not win this trade that takes advantage of people's need
2089,1518249270041792512,All of it from our backs  😅
2090,1518245785347018755,It will benefit.. as long as the internet is weak and people pay to increase it 
2091,1518244393152561153,The strange thing is that in each season the profits are in the tens of millions but by the end of the year it becomes clear that it is losing like other government companies
2092,1518243943485485059,If they improve the packages what will they lose 🥲
2093,1518227675730558976,"Our National Company With greetings **  We hope to hear good news about contributing to support the technical developmental aspect in schools,  thank you."
2094,1518223610892140546,Ok now you are pressing people more than they are already pressed from you
2095,1518215593249456129,All of this is because I upgraded my package 😁
2096,1518209642777743360,At least offer some good offers for the subscribers
2097,1518204327587946496,Because there are no other competitors
2098,1518200217815900161,Lend me a thousand for necessity
2099,1518190310001717248,Why are you sharing the profits are you going to donate to the poor people we all know that all these profits are from the people what have you done to earn it
2100,1518183488272445440,They are thieves 😂
2101,1518182135944953856,Good luck omantel you deserve more
2102,1518181849994043392,You used the red mark to get attention and now people are swearing at you
2103,1518180679997173761,half of it is from the games that you get thanks to us
2104,1518179254164459520,from how?
2105,1518177929703927809,When the tax came the theft increased 6 rials are taken when subscribing to a 5.5 rials offer where did the half rial go🤷🏻‍♂️we don't know
2106,1518177859373830144,"Normal, compared to the prices of services and subscription and the lack of real competition.👍"
2107,1518176951034339328,Question
2108,1518175369001672706,Are you sure 😂😂😂
2109,1518174891715006465,Expected

2111,1518163358549266432,This is one of their moves 😂
2112,1518160132441616384,I hope you lose
2113,1518148965044301829,Half of their fortune comes from subscribing to the game bundle 😂
2114,1518136238758404096,By scam
2115,1518133290968006656,In three months !!! 😦😦

2121,1517523754498330626,He looks like he's dreaming to become a minister again
2122,1517470059878359042,"Oman does not need ministers, it needs governors, general managers, directors of departments, heads of departments, and employees only."
2123,1517460529463406596,"When he was in office, we have not heard anything from him."
2124,1517439870930722816,"They think everything is easy to come when they rush to the position, This needs conscience and overwork and convey the citizens' needs to the Sultan."
2125,1517434482806112257,"The problem is that we have a failed scared media, they do not know how to reply to those officials."
2126,1517422026151104513,😎😁😎😁 No comment..

2129,1516808035657818118,Excellent
2130,1517561615813591044,"We have military retirees who faced bitter situation in remote places and lived all seasons with cruel heat and cold; and endured far places and danger zones. And their service was for more than 30 years, yet their salaries have not reached half of 700 Rials."
2131,1517464072991686656,"Why the focus on people of social security and low income, I mean the retired, who their salaries are not more than 400 rials or not even reaching this amount; and who have to provide living for seven or more dependents. "
2132,1517412036862431234,"I do not understand the situation of the opposition. Does it mean you will pay them from your pockets, for instance?"
2133,1516872945708277762,I hope that an allowance will be given to every citizen working in government or private sector that is more than 300 rials
